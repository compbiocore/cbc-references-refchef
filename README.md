# CBC References for RefChef
RefChef references on CCV's Oscar and Stronghold

-----

#### This repo is used to request new references to be downloaded with RefChef to Oscar and Stronghold. It's meant to be used by CBC members for now. In the future, users can submit pull-requests with their references.

# Requesting references

To request references, create a `yaml` file, following the [RefChef YAML specs](https://compbiocore.github.io/refchef/specs/).
Use the standardized file name:

`refchef_<brown_username>_<ddmmyy>.yaml`

Push to `develop`, submit a PR to `master`. I'll merge the PR after we download the reference.
